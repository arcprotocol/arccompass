# Contributing to ARC Compass

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ARC Compass as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the documentation with details of any new functionality
3. The PR should work for all supported environments
4. PR will be merged once it receives approval from maintainers

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Write tests for new features
- Document public APIs
- Keep the codebase clean and maintainable

## Project Structure

- `/src` - Source code
  - `/core` - Core routing logic
  - `/api` - API interfaces
  - `/models` - Data models
  - `/services` - Services for interacting with external systems
  - `/utils` - Utility functions
- `/tests` - Test suite
- `/docs` - Documentation
- `/examples` - Example implementations

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We also use GitHub issues to track feature requests. When proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome
